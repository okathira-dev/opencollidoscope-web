official site <http://collidoscope.io/>

> Collidoscope is driven by our vision to make digital sound and music more palpable, immediate, and magical for both performers and audience.
> Collidoscope is an interactive musical instrument developed by [Ben Bengler](http://benbengler.com/) and [Fiore Martin](http://fioremartin.com/) in March 2015. Fill it with sound and explore, and in the next moment, play and perform it like a musical instrument.
